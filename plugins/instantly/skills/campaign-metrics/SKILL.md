## Score Calculation

### Campaign Health Score (0-100)

```
health_score = (
    open_score * 0.25 +
    reply_score * 0.35 +
    deliverability_score * 0.25 +
    trend_score * 0.15
)
```

**Component Calculations:**

```
open_score = normalize(open_rate, min=0, max=60)
  60%+ open = 100 points
  40% open = 67 points
  20% open = 33 points
  0% open = 0 points

reply_score = normalize(reply_rate, min=0, max=15)
  15%+ reply = 100 points
  10% reply = 67 points
  5% reply = 33 points
  0% reply = 0 points

deliverability_score = 100 - (bounce_rate * 10)
  0% bounce = 100 points
  5% bounce = 50 points
  10% bounce = 0 points

trend_score = based on week-over-week change
  +10% improvement = 100 points
  Stable = 50 points
  -10% decline = 0 points
```

### Score Interpretation

| Score | Rating | Action Required |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | Maintain, scale if possible |
| 75-89 | Good | Minor optimizations |
| 60-74 | Average | Address weak areas |
| 40-59 | Poor | Major revision needed |
| 0-39 | Critical | Pause and fix immediately |
