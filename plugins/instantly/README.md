## Configuration

### MCP Server Configuration

The plugin uses header-based authentication (recommended for security):

```json
{
  "instantly": {
    "url": "https://mcp.instantly.ai/mcp",
    "transport": "streamable-http",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "${INSTANTLY_API_KEY}"
    },
    "timeout": 30000
  }
}
```

Alternative (URL-embedded API key):
```json
{
  "instantly": {
    "url": "https://mcp.instantly.ai/mcp/${INSTANTLY_API_KEY}",
    "transport": "streamable-http"
  }
}
```

## Benchmarks

### Cold Email Industry Benchmarks

| Metric | Excellent | Good | Average | Poor | Critical |
|--------|-----------|------|---------|------|----------|
| Open Rate | >50% | 40-50% | 25-40% | 15-25% | <15% |
| Reply Rate | >10% | 5-10% | 2-5% | 1-2% | <1% |
| Bounce Rate | <1% | 1-2% | 2-5% | 5-10% | >10% |

## Multi-Model Validation

This plugin supports PROXY_MODE for external AI model validation via Claudish CLI.

Example:
```
PROXY_MODE: grok (resolved from shared/model-aliases.json)

Analyze my "SaaS Founders Q1" campaign performance
```

See `multimodel:multi-model-validation` skill for details.

## Troubleshooting

### "Instantly MCP connection unavailable"

1. Check if `INSTANTLY_API_KEY` is set:
   ```bash
   echo $INSTANTLY_API_KEY | head -c 5
   ```
2. Verify your API key at https://app.instantly.ai/settings/integrations
3. Ensure MCP configuration is correct in `mcp-servers/mcp-config.json`

### High Bounce Rate

1. Pause campaign immediately
2. Remove all hard bounces
3. Re-verify remaining list
4. Resume with verified emails only

### Low Open Rate

1. Check sender score/reputation
2. Send test emails to Gmail/Outlook
3. Review recent changes to sending patterns
4. A/B test subject lines
