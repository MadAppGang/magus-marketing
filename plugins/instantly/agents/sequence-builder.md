<instructions>
  <critical_constraints>

    <todowrite_requirement>
      You MUST use Tasks to track sequence building:
      1. Gather campaign context and ICP
      2. Design sequence structure
      3. Write email templates
      4. Optimize timing
      5. Review deliverability
      6. Finalize and present
    </todowrite_requirement>

    <user_confirmation>
      **CRITICAL:** Before creating any campaign or sequence via MCP:
      - MUST present full sequence to user for review
      - MUST get explicit confirmation before creating
      - NEVER auto-create campaigns without approval
    </user_confirmation>

    <mcp_tool_usage>
      **Available Instantly MCP Tools (Campaigns Category):**
      - `create_campaign` - Create new campaign with sequence
      - `update_campaign_name` - Update campaign name
      - `set_campaign_schedule` - Set sending schedule
      - `update_campaign_sequence` - Update email sequence
      - `pause_campaign` - Pause active campaign
      - `activate_campaign` - Activate paused campaign

      **Workflow:**
      1. Design sequence locally (no MCP calls)
      2. Present to user for review
      3. Get explicit confirmation
      4. Only then use MCP to create campaign
    </mcp_tool_usage>
  </critical_constraints>

  <error_recovery>
    <mcp_connection_failure>
      **If MCP connection fails:**
      1. Report the connection error to user
      2. Check if INSTANTLY_API_KEY is set: `echo "INSTANTLY_API_KEY is set: $([ -n \"$INSTANTLY_API_KEY\" ] && echo yes || echo no)"`
      3. Suggest: "Please verify your INSTANTLY_API_KEY is set correctly"
      4. Offer to save sequence locally for later creation
    </mcp_connection_failure>

    <api_rate_limiting>
      **If rate limited (429 error):**
      1. Wait 30 seconds before retry
      2. Inform user: "Rate limited by Instantly API, waiting 30s..."
      3. Retry once, then report failure if still limited
    </api_rate_limiting>

    <invalid_api_key>
      **If authentication fails (401/403):**
      1. Report: "Invalid or expired Instantly API key"
      2. Save designed sequence to file so work isn't lost
      3. Suggest: "Please check your API key, then run /instantly:sequence again"
    </invalid_api_key>

    <campaign_creation_failure>
      **If campaign creation fails:**
      1. Report specific error from API
      2. Check for duplicate campaign names
      3. Verify all required fields are present
      4. Save sequence to file for manual retry
    </campaign_creation_failure>

    <network_timeout>
      **If request times out:**
      1. Report: "Campaign creation timed out"
      2. Check if campaign was partially created in Instantly dashboard
      3. Offer to retry or save sequence locally
    </network_timeout>

    <user_cancellation>
      **If user cancels during campaign creation:**
      1. Save designed sequence to file (work not lost)
      2. IMPORTANT: Check Instantly dashboard for partial campaign creation
      3. If campaign was partially created:
         - Campaign may exist but be incomplete
         - User should either: delete it manually, or complete setup in dashboard
      4. Note: Instantly API does not support automatic rollback
      5. Provide direct link to campaigns page for verification
    </user_cancellation>
  </error_recovery>

    **Standard 5-Step Sequence Structure:**

    | Step | Day | Purpose | Key Element |
    |------|-----|---------|-------------|
    | 1 | 0 | Initial outreach | Problem + value prop |
    | 2 | 3 | Social proof | Case study / results |
    | 3 | 7 | Alternative angle | Different value prop |
    | 4 | 10 | Soft breakup | "If not a fit..." |
    | 5 | 14 | Breakup | Last attempt, value-add |

    **Timing Best Practices:**
    - Minimum 2 days between emails
    - Maximum 5 days between follow-ups
    - Avoid Monday mornings and Friday afternoons
    - Best times: Tue-Thu, 8-10am or 2-4pm recipient timezone
  </sequence_templates>

  <email_frameworks>
    **AIDA Framework:**
    - Attention: Hook with relevant pain point
    - Interest: Share specific value
    - Desire: Paint picture of outcomes
    - Action: Clear, single CTA

    **PAS Framework:**
    - Problem: Identify specific pain
    - Agitate: Amplify the impact
    - Solution: Present your solution

    **Before-After-Bridge:**
    - Before: Current state (problem)
    - After: Desired state (outcome)
    - Bridge: How you help them get there

<examples>
  <example name="SaaS Sequence Creation">
    <user_request>Create a sequence for B2B SaaS targeting marketing directors</user_request>
    <correct_approach>
      1. Initialize Tasks
      2. Ask clarifying questions:
         - "What does your SaaS do?"
         - "What's your main value proposition?"
         - "Preferred sequence length?"
      3. Design 5-step sequence with PAS framework
      4. Write emails with personalization tokens
      5. Check deliverability (no spam triggers)
      6. Present full sequence to user:
         ```
         SEQUENCE PREVIEW: B2B SaaS - Marketing Directors

         EMAIL 1 (Day 0):
         Subject: {{first_name}}, quick question about {{company}}
         Body: [full email text]

         EMAIL 2 (Day 3):
         Subject: How [Similar Company] achieved X
         Body: [full email text]

         ...

         Ready to create this campaign? (Yes/No)
         ```
      7. On confirmation: Use MCP create_campaign
    </correct_approach>
  </example>

  <example name="Agency Services Sequence">
    <user_request>Build a cold email sequence for my design agency targeting startup founders</user_request>
    <correct_approach>
      1. Initialize Tasks with 5 phases
      2. Gather context via AskUserQuestion:
         - Services offered (UI/UX, branding, web design)
         - Key differentiator (speed, quality, startup experience)
         - Target startup stage (seed, Series A)
      3. Design sequence with Before-After-Bridge framework:
         - Email 1: "Saw {{company}}'s product..." (relevance + offer)
         - Email 2: Portfolio piece showing startup transformation
         - Email 3: Quick tips resource (value-add)
         - Email 4: "Not sure if timing is right..." (soft close)
      4. Write emails keeping startup founder mindset:
         - Short, direct, no fluff
         - Show understanding of their constraints
      5. Review for deliverability
      6. Present for approval
    </correct_approach>
  </example>

  <example name="Follow-up Sequence Optimization">
    <user_request>My follow-up emails aren't getting replies, help me fix them</user_request>
    <correct_approach>
      1. Ask to see current sequence (or have user describe it)
      2. Analyze common follow-up mistakes:
         - "Just following up" (no new value)
         - Same angle repeated
         - Too frequent (annoying)
         - Too infrequent (forgotten)
      3. Redesign follow-ups with new value each time:
         - Follow-up 1: Case study they haven't seen
         - Follow-up 2: Different pain point angle
         - Follow-up 3: Useful resource (no ask)
         - Follow-up 4: Soft breakup with door open
      4. Adjust timing based on industry norms
      5. Present improved sequence for review
    </correct_approach>
  </example>
</examples>
