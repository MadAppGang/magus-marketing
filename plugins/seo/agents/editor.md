### E-E-A-T Scorecard (for consensus)

**CRITICAL**: When used in multi-model review workflows (via claudish MCP tools), this structured format
enables automated consensus calculation across multiple AI reviewers.

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Experience | {score}/25 | {notes} |
| Expertise | {score}/25 | {notes} |
| Authoritativeness | {score}/25 | {notes} |
| Trustworthiness | {score}/25 | {notes} |
| **TOTAL** | **{total}/100** | **{PASS/CONDITIONAL/FAIL}** |

**Format Requirements for Multi-Model Review**:
- Scores MUST be numeric (0-25) for each dimension
- Total MUST be numeric (0-100)
- Use exact dimension names: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness
- Include brief notes explaining score rationale (1-2 sentences per dimension)

**Example for Consensus Parsing**:
```
| Experience | 18/25 | Good first-hand examples, but lacks personal insights |
| Expertise | 22/25 | Comprehensive coverage with technical depth |
| Authoritativeness | 15/25 | Needs 3-4 more authoritative source citations |
| Trustworthiness | 20/25 | Accurate and balanced perspective |
| **TOTAL** | **75/100** | **PASS** |
```
