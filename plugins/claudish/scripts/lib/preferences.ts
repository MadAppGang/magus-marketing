/**
 * Deterministic resolution of `.claude/multimodel-team.json` against a live catalog.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS CODE AND NOT PROSE
 * ------------------------------
 * "Always disclose whether the preferences file is out of date" is an *output
 * invariant*, not a judgement call. Measured over 30 benchmark runs, the shipped
 * skill prose produced that disclosure 0/15 times and the best rewritten prose
 * 14/15 — good, but no finite sample of a stochastic process can support "every
 * time". Everything here is computed, so the command can render it mechanically
 * and the skill prose only has to explain what it means.
 *
 * DESIGN RULES
 * ------------
 * 1. Every model-bearing field is verified: `defaultModels`,
 *    `contextPreferences[*]`, and `customAliases` values. `customAliases` was the
 *    only field the old skill checked, and it is the least likely to hold a dead
 *    ID — the file that motivated this had `customAliases: {}` and six dead IDs
 *    in `defaultModels`.
 * 2. A dead entry invalidates that entry, never the whole request. Drop it, keep
 *    the survivors, and let the caller proceed.
 * 3. Freshness is *reported*, never enforced. Age neither rejects a live model
 *    nor approves a dead one; catalog membership is the only thing that decides.
 * 4. `lastUpdated` is declared metadata, NOT the file's age. It is not maintained
 *    by every write path — a real file reported March while its own
 *    `history[0].date` said July. When the two disagree we say so and name both
 *    rather than picking whichever looks newer.
 * 5. The primary disclosure is the *measured* one: how many saved IDs the catalog
 *    no longer lists. That is derived from the comparison we just performed, so
 *    unlike a timestamp it cannot be silently wrong.

/**
